# Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis was to better familiarize ourselves with Postgres SQL to explore and manipulate data. We familiarized ourselves with SQL by writing basic statements, designing/managing tables and creating relationship entity diagrams. In this particular example we imported, joined and filtered company HR data to help answer questions such as 1. Who will be retiring in the next few years and 2. How many positions will they need to fill?

## Results

Two takeaways from Retiring Titles:

* A total of around 90,000 positions across the company are in position for retirement
* A large amount of senior positions will be leaving the company. The two largest categories of retiring titles are senior engineers and senior staff comprising of around 58,000 positions between the two. These two categories make up roughly 64% of all retiring titles.

Two takeaways from Mentorship Eligibility:

* A total of around fifteen-hundred positions are eligible for mentorship
* The position with the largest amount of eligible retirement is Senior Staff, with almost a third of all mentorship eligible positions (428 total)
