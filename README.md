# Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis was to better familiarize ourselves with Postgres SQL to explore and manipulate data. We familiarized ourselves with SQL by writing basic statements, designing/managing tables and creating relationship entity diagrams. In this particular example we imported, joined and filtered company HR data to help answer questions such as 1. Who will be retiring in the next few years and 2. How many positions will they need to fill?

# Results

Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed

Two takeaways from Retiring Titles:

* A total of around ninety-thousand positions across the company that are in position for retirement
* A large amount of senior positions will be leaving the company. The two largest categories of retiring titles are senior engineers and senior staff. These two categories make up roughly 64% of all retiring titles with a total of around fifty-eigh thousand between the two.

Two takeaways from Mentorship Eligibility:

* 3
